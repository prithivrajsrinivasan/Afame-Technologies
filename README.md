# PROJECT 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION
**Project Overview: Titanic Survival Prediction Data Analysis**

### Objective
The objective of this project is to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using various machine learning algorithms. By analyzing the historical passenger data, we aim to build a predictive model that accurately determines whether a passenger survived the disaster or not.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers on the Titanic. The dataset includes the following features:

- **PassengerId:** Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Survived:** Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- **Pclass:** Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
- **Name:** Name of the passenger
- **Sex:** Gender of the passenger
- **Age:** Age of the passenger
- **SibSp:** Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch:** Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket:** Ticket number
- **Fare:** Passenger fare
- **Cabin:** Cabin number
- **Embarked:** Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

### Steps Involved

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset and explore its structure and content.
   - Handle missing values, particularly in the 'Age', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked' columns.
   - Convert categorical variables into numerical values (e.g., 'Sex', 'Embarked').
   - Feature engineering to create new features or modify existing ones for better prediction.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize the distribution of various features.
   - Analyze the correlation between features and the target variable (Survived).
   - Identify patterns and insights that could influence survival rates.

3. **Model Building**
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression).
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics called accuracy.

4. **Model Evaluation and Selection**
   - Compare the performance of different models.
   - Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
   - Fine-tune the selected model using hyperparameter optimization techniques.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook.

### Expected Outcomes
- A trained machine learning model capable of predicting the survival of Titanic passengers with high accuracy.
- Insights into the factors that played a significant role in determining the survival of passengers.
- A detailed report and visualizations that effectively communicate the findings and model performance.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to apply data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization techniques to a historical dataset, enhancing understanding and skills in predictive modeling.






# PROJECT 2: SALES DATA ANALYSIS

**Project Overview: E-Commerce Data Analysis**

### Objective
To analyze the provided e-commerce data to identify patterns, revenue indicators, and best-selling items. This analysis will help inform business decision-making and enhance data visualisation efforts by uncovering trends in customer behavior, product performance, and return patterns. The goal is to optimize inventory management, enhance customer satisfaction, and increase overall profitability.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic E-Commerce dataset, which contains information about the Sales on the Business. The dataset includes the following tables:
- **Orders**
- **Returns**
- **People** 

### Measures Analyzed
- Identified Total Sales
- Analyzed Sales Trends Over-time
- Determined the best-selling products

### Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft PowerBi
- Power Query Editor

### Expected Outcomes
- Comprehensive understanding of total sales figures over a defined period.
- Detailed analysis of sales trends over specific time intervals.
- Insights into product performance by category, helping to identify the most profitable categories.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to apply data analysis and data visualization techniques to a E-Commerce dataset, enhancing understanding and skills in Sales Analysis.
